# Markdown Parser

This is the part that takes in markdown and outputs valid HTML. As of now, it's buggy, as I need more tests, but it works for real basic stuff.

## Currently supports:

### Text blocks

* Headers
* Paragraphs (with line breaks, if on adjacent lines)

### Formatting

* Strong
* Links
* Emphasis
* Pre
* Code
* Horizontal rules

### Data

* Lists
* Tables (only with a header row)
* Images
