# Routes:

## Build a page:

* [ ] invoke program with folder name
  * [ ] load config file (site URL, settings, etc.)
  * [ ] load all modules (header, footer, nav, etc.)
  * [ ] create dict to hold all page info (title, description, location/folder, HTML)
    * Should be used at the end with RSS generator and any TOC-style pages
  * [ ] create dict for all folder info (name, path)
    * use for nav links
  * [ ] create dict for all module info (name, HTML)
    * Once you have parsed a module once, you should not have to do it again
  * [ ] prepare templater
    * [ ] create templater instance
    * [ ] add all templates to instance
    * [ ] fill templates in all modules that are not page specific including meta HTML (DOCTYPE, HTML, head, etc.)
  * [ ] parse markdown files
    * [ ] for each file in root folder
      * [ ] break out front matter and markdown
      * [ ] Add front matter to page dict (date, title, desc, path, etc)
      * [ ] fill out the rest of the module templates
      * [x] parse markdown file into HTML
      * [ ] put modules and post together into finished HTML
      * [ ] write to file in new folder
      * [ ] add to front matter dict
        * [ ] generate link using config
        * [ ] populate with front matter
      * [ ] build all meta files
        * [ ] generate an index.html including all pages in current folder
        * [ ] any special files (_about.md => about.html)
          * prefaced by single underscore removes file from indexing in index.html 
    * [ ] for each folder in markdown folder
      * [ ] create new folder in output
      * [ ] do the same as in the root folder
  * [ ] Generate RSS feed
    * [ ] Get all info from pages dict
    * [ ] populate RSS feed template
