# MD 2 HTML

The goal is a dead simple markdown to HTML converter with as few frills as possible. Put in markdown, receive valid HTML, put on site.

Organizing a site should be as easy as having your folder of pages and folder of templates and running the function. Nothing more complex than markdown, some template files, and a config. Then you make your CSS and you're done.

## Why?

I like making things. I'm currently using Jekyll and I like it a lot! But I really don't even need those features and want to sacrifice some of those capabilities of a "complex" website for ease of use, maintenance, and joy of making stuff. Think 2000 HTML.

## Features

* *Parse basic markdown to HTML* (in progress, see folder)
* ~~Use templates for header/footer and navigation~~
* ~~Config to provide context to all generated pages (CSS, meta, etc.)~~
* ~~Generate RSS feed of all pages~~
