<h1>MD 2 HTML</h1>
<p>The goal is a dead simple markdown to HTML converter with as few frills as possible. Put in markdown, receive valid HTML, put on site.</p>
<p>Organizing a site should be as easy as having your folder of pages and folder of templates and running the function. Nothing more complex than markdown, some template files, and a config. Then you make your CSS and you're done.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I like making things. I'm currently using Jekyll and I like it a lot! But I really don't even need those features and want to sacrifice some of those capabilities of a "complex" website for ease of use, maintenance, and joy of making stuff. Think 2000 HTML.</p>
